# Shared Notes Bot

A collaborative Discord bot for managing shared notes in your server. Designed for admins, mods, and teams to create, edit, and organize important information with robust permissions and a modern UX.

---

## üö¶ Permission System Overview

**This bot uses a per-user, per-channel permission system for creating, editing, and deleting notes.**

- Users must be explicitly granted permission for each channel using `/config-grant`.
- Server owners and admins always have full access and can grant permissions.
- Roles can be configured for listing and config commands via `/snote-config`.
- Edit buttons on notes also respect permissions.

See below for details on each command and how permissions work.
